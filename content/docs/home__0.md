#### About Trici

Trici is a desktop application which helps developers recover faster from interruptions and thus improves their productivity. It also helps in faster context switching between tasks. It does this by helping you recover your lost train of thought, faster. Typically, it may take anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes to recover one's train of thought and start coding productively once again. Trici reduces this to less than 2 minutes in most cases.

For a more elaborate write up on how Trici does this and why it was built, read [this post](https://www.gettrici.com/blog/introducing-trici-a-new-tool-to-help-developers-conquer-interruptions-and-be-happy/) on our blog or watch the intro video below:
