# Installation


Trici is currently in beta and available only for macOS (10.12 or higher) and Ubuntu (14.10+). It may work on OS versions lower than what has been specified, but we have not tested it on those. It needs a minimum of 8GB RAM. 16GB or more RAM is recommended for people who keep lots of Chrome tabs open. For macOS, only the Intel chipset is supported. A version supporting Apple Silicon is expected in August 2021.

The installation packages formats are .dmg for macOS and .deb for Ubuntu and the installation process is standard for these formats.

On MacOS, Trici requires you to grant Screen Recording permissions. After installation when you start Trici for the first time, it will prompt you to give the requisite permissions. Once you grant the permissions, you will have to restart the app.
